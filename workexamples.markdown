# <u>Unity Asset Package: 3D Book</u>
A Unity Package created by me that started out as an R&D project and turned into a really cool 3D book application.
Using a cone deformation algorithm, a 3D mesh deforms over time and makes it look like a page in a book being flipped. 
The pages are externally loaded allowing for users to generate their own flip books with as much customization as possible. 

* 2022, Unity, C#, shaders (hlsl)
