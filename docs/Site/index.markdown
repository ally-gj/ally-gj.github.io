# School Projects

## Assimilated

A school project for pre-capstone where I was the one and only programmer.
This was my first time using Unity and exploring what all it could do.

*VIDEO HERE*

## Cosmo Ball

A sports-like 3D multi-player game where the objective is to hold on to the ball for as long as possible.
To obtain the ball, be faster than your oppenents and use your surroundings to escape.

Can be used with a mouse and keyboard, or an Xbox Controller.

## Carry On

A senior Capstone project where I was the one and only programmer.
This was my first time using Unity 3D, landscape generation, 3D animations, and particle effects.
