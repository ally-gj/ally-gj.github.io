Hello! My name is Ally Goodman-Janow and I am a Software Developer.

I have a Bachelors of Science from the Univertsity of New Mexico with a focus in Computer Science, and a minor in Interdisciplinary Film and Digital Media.

I graduated in 2018 with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 and with honors.

I've been working at a tech company in Corrales, NM since I graduated and have become the Managing Senior Developer over the course of 6 years, and I'm tasked with HR & management, as well as programming and upkeeping the framework we use everyday.

Unity and C# are my main programming go-to's, but I have used many other languages, such as Java, C, C++, Javascript, and so on.

Web languages are also something I've learned over the years, so I've played with PHP, Laravel, HTML, Vue, and more. 

Overall, I'm pretty flexible when it comes to learning, and I can pick up new programs / languages quickly.

My greatest joys in programming are 2D UI/UX and animations, but 3D also intrigues me since I don't often get the chance to use it in my current line of work.
