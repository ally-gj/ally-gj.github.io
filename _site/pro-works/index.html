    <p>All of the following works have been programmed by myself, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h1 id="african-art"><u>African Art</u></h1>
<p>A touch table application made for the National Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.
This application was programmed by myself and another developer. 
We broke it up into 2 pieces: the animated map background and the user interactable UI.</p>

<p>I was in charge of programming the UI, image loading, and general animations.</p>

<h1 id="electromagnetic-spectrum-object-viewer"><u>Electromagnetic Spectrum Object Viewer</u></h1>
<p>A touch table application built to let users look at different objects in different wavelengths.
By dragging your object along the screen horizontally, the item is revealed in the 4-7 wavelengths and are accompanied by short descriptions.</p>

<p>This was originally written in Flash, but when Flash was no longer supported, I was tasked with making a Unity remake.
I made a 4k version which includes 4 wavelengths, an 8k version which includes all 7 wavlengths, and a touch wall version that displays in one direction, rather than top and bottom.</p>

<p>I have also made this version in English, Spanish, German, and Arabic with the use of TextMeshPro.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2018 to current, Unity, C#, shaders (hlsl)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="austin-condos-real-estate-app"><u>Austin Condos Real Estate App</u></h1>
<p>A touch wall application made for a realty company in Austin, Texas, used for selling $$$ condos in a building that didn’t yet exist.</p>

<p>We were provided with a 3D Model of the building and some renderings of what it should look like.
The rest was essentially up to us to make it look realistic and to include the correct information about the available condos.</p>

<p>Features included: a quiz to help find the right condo for the buyer, 180 degree panorama views from each condo, a localized CMS so that the realtor could mark a condo as “pending” or “sold” (opened by using a 3-finger hold over the Linden logo).</p>

<ul>
  <li>2020, Unity, C#, 3D models, lighting</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="jcc-donor-wall"><u>JCC Donor Wall</u></h1>
<p>The Jewish Community Center wanted to replace their existing donor wall with a newer, more high-tech option, so we made them a digital interactive with an externalized CMS so they can add / remove / keep track of donors going forward.</p>

<p>The design was inspired by the Tree of Life, and each donor name gets added to a leaf on the tree. All of the content is dynamic, so if one donor has an image and a story to tell, they can input those and they will change the scale and layout of the UI elements on screen. In the opposite case, if a donor has nothing but their name and the amount donated, the UI will scale down, making sure it doesn’t seem empty.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2021, Unity, C#, Google Sheets API</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="synagogues-360"><u>Synagogues 360</u></h1>
<p>An immersive experience application written for the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art (located in Tulsa, Oklahoma) when a very talented photographer and donor Louis Davidson became ill and needed a way to memorialize his 360 panorama images of Synagogues from all over the world.</p>

<p>This application features over 600 panormas that can be explored by location or by theme, and then is presented on a secondary monitor so that many users can gather around the table and view the synagogues together.</p>

<h1 id="altoona-historical-viewer"><u>Altoona Historical Viewer</u></h1>

<p>The Altoona, Iowa Historical Viewer was created for the Altoona, Iowa Historial Society so that they could post about upcoming events, show pictures of founders, leaders, and the community, as well as view a map of the area and mark interesting places to visit.</p>

<p>Pair programmed with a coworker for the Colonial Willaimsburg onsite museum.
Contains collections of maps and prints that have been digitized so that users can view items up close, as well as items that aren’t on display.</p>

<h1 id="san-diego-zoo-applications"><u>San Diego Zoo Applications</u></h1>

<ul>
  <li>2021, Unity, C#, Arduino, SMTP</li>
</ul>

<p>There were about 6 different software applications that we were hired to make for the San Diego Zoo’s new bugarium in 2021, and I made 2 of them: the Microscope Station and the Conservation Quiz.</p>

<p>The microscope station consisted of a usb connected microscope, a push button, and a touch screen.
Children would pick a specimen, place it under the microscope, then use the push button to take a picture of it.</p>

<p><img src="sdz1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>That picture would show up in the software and would allow the kids to draw on it, place stickers, and add filters.
They could then email it to themselves.

<h1 id="bisti-beast"><u>Bisti Beast</u></h1>

<ul>
  <li>2019, Unity, C#</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bisti Beast application was built for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History after archeologists discovered fossils of a new type of T-Rex, that they later named the Bisti Beast.</p>

<p>I worked closely with an archeologist / geologist to gather the content / text / images / videos for the application.</p>

<h1 id="unity-asset-package-3d-book"><u>Unity Asset Package: 3D Book</u></h1>
<p>A Unity Package created by me that started out as an R&amp;D project and turned into a really cool 3D book application.
Using a cone deformation algorithm, a 3D mesh deforms over time and makes it look like a page in a book being flipped. 
The pages are externally loaded allowing for users to generate their own flip books with as much customization as possible.</p>
